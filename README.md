## Our idea 

Our project aims to explore the higher energy states of quantum hardware ( based on the  prefernece [6.2 Accessing Higher Energy States](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/accessing_higher_energy_states.html) and put together an idea of generating random number using higher energy states of quantum hardware.

A true random number generator is a device that generates random numbers from physical process, not from an algorithm. Such kind of devices are often based on microscopic phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random "noise" signals ( such as quanutm phenomena ). There are many quantum phenomena which can be used for random number generator but we focus on the phenomena "Photons travelling through a semi-transparent mirror. The mutually exclusive events (reflection/transmission) are detected and associated to ‘0’ or ‘1’ bit values respectively".

At first our team idea is if the exclusive events(reflection/transmission) are deteceted and associated to more than 2 state 0’ or ‘1’ bit values, the randomness can be increased when generating the random number from this phenomena and it also leads to incompatible measurement. However, when searching for more information we found out that the idea of using this phenomena to generate a random has been proposed [here](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.054306) in 2009 and later been certified with the Kochen-Specker Theorem [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03687) in 2017.
